## About Me ðŸ¤–
I work with AI, and spend way too much time on it atm. I love working with Python and TypeScript atm, but I'm equally enthusiastic about C#, and loves to delve into other things, like Elixir, Rust, Go, etc. 
Fully engaged in uniting people and technology, I ensure to provide dedicated interdisciplinary teams delivering valuable work that meets customer needs.
